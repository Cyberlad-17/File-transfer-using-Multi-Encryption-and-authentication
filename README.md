Project Title: Secure Data Encryption using AES, RSA, and HMAC

Description:

In today's digital world, data security is of paramount importance. This project aims to build a robust and reliable data encryption system that ensures your sensitive information remains safe from unauthorized access and tampering. To achieve this, we combine three powerful cryptographic algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and Message Authentication Code (MAC) to create a multi-layered security approach.

Key Features:

1. AES Encryption: AES is a widely adopted and efficient symmetric encryption algorithm. With AES, we can securely encrypt and decrypt data using the same secret key. This ensures your data remains confidential and safe from external agents.

2. RSA Encryption: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that allows secure key exchange between parties. With RSA, we can establish a secure communication channel by encrypting the AES secret key and transmit it along with the encrypted payload, therefore enabling secure data transmission.

3. MAC Authentication: To ensure Data Integrity and Authenticity, we employ MAC Code, which generates a unique authentication code for each data message. This code is based on a cryptographic hash function and serves as a digital fingerprint. Any unauthorized modifications to the data will be immediately detected, ensuring data integrity.

4. Key Management: Proper key management is crucial for maintaining the overall security of the encryption process. We have implemented a robust key management system to securely generate, store, and handle encryption and decryption keys for both AES and RSA.

5. User Interface: To make data encryption user-friendly, we provide a simple and intuitive interface. Users can easily input their data, check for their encrypted payload, and securely transmit through TCP Channel as well as access their decrypted data using proper authentication.

6. Comprehensive Documentation: To guide users effectively, we offer comprehensive documentation. This documentation includes clear explanations of the algorithms used, best practices for key management, and guidelines for secure data handling.

By combining AES, RSA, and HMAC, we create a powerful and flexible data encryption solution. Our project aims to empower users with a secure tool to protect their sensitive information and promote a safer digital environment.

Note:

- Security is a top priority for cryptographic projects. We advise seeking input from security experts to review and audit the codebase to ensure maximum security.
- To ensure data security, users are encouraged to follow best security practices when using this system, such as keeping their encryption keys safe and using strong passwords for authentication.
